# Benchmarking Framework for Bad Weather Distortion in Object Detection / Semantic Segmentation in the Context of Autonomous Driving

## Proposal Recap
A benchmarking framework proposing a standard dataset and procedure to assess the performance of bad weather denoising models in an autonomous driving scenario. The aim is to provide an accessible framework that proposes to evaluate denoising models on a special road dataset. The user should input a candidate denoising model and our framework will perform tests with various metrics to assess performance of the candidate model.

This repository contains:
- distorted (bad weather condition) image dataset,
- state-of-art model to perform evaluation task (semantic segmentation or object detection),
- description of the methods that a candidate model needs to offer to use the framework,
- pipeline to get metrics about the performance of a candidate model.
