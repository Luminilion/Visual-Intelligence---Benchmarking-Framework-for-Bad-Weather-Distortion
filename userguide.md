# Instructions to run the benchmarking framework

## Pre-requisites for your model

[TODO: Insert all information on what the user needs to have in its data for the framework to function correctly]

1. A **requirements file**: A txt file containing all requirements of modules with their versions for the model to run properly.
Follow the naming convention `*-requirements.txt` where * is the name of your model to avoid errors.

## Place your files

1. Create a folder with your model's name inside the folder `candidate_model`.
2. Place your trained model and your python files to load and predict with your model. [TODO: more specifications
according to the files and functions needed]
3. Place your **requirements file** inside the `requirements_files` folder.

## Run the framework

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the root of this repository.
3. Run the command `python src/run.py`.

## See the results

[TODO: Explain where the user can find the results]
